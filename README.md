# Listify
**An iOS app developed in Swift at Angel Hacks SV 2015. **
created by Heejung Chung, Kavya Tewari, and Claire Huang

With our app Listify, friends and family members can easily share individual shopping lists. When users arrive at a store, Listify will display items added by both the users and their friends, but only the ones that are available at that particular store. Users can then purchase items for their friends and family.
